    "The four pillars for OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction\n",
    "    Data abstraction is the most essential function of object-oriented programming in C++. \n",
    "    Abstraction means displaying only basic information and hiding the details. \n",
    "    Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "    In common terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. \n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.\n",
    "    Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding. Using Encapsulation also hides the data. \n",
    "    In the previous example, the data of any of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance\n",
    "    Inheritance is the process in which two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class. \n",
    "    The class which inherits the features is known as the child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class.\n",
    "    Subclass\n",
    "        The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Superclass\n",
    "        The class that inherits sub-class properties is called Base class or superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "    The word polymorphism means having many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form. \n",
    "    It is a feature that provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. \n",
    "    It can be implemented using function overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function. \n",
    "    An operation may show off different behaviors at different times."
